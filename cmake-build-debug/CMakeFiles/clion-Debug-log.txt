CMake Error at C:/Users/kilia/.vcpkg-clion/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake:859 (_find_package):
  By not providing "FindSDL2_gfx.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "SDL2_gfx",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "SDL2_gfx" with any
  of the following names:

    SDL2_gfxConfig.cmake
    sdl2_gfx-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "SDL2_gfx" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "SDL2_gfx_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "SDL2_gfx" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
